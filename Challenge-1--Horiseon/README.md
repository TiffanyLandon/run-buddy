# Challenge-1--Horiseon
Redoing the Horiseon website to make it more accessibility

Refactor the code given to me by Horisen
Changing the <div> in lines 18 and 30 to <nav> is inline level element that allows a screen reader to read it more.

Changing the link to search engline optimization on line 22 with more of a descrition. 
  
  In line 35 I changed to section for a semantic because div is a block element.
  
  On line 36 I also changed div to article to express the paragraphs that is wrote on the website.
  
  On line 38 I added  Id to make the link work for search engine optimization.
  
  On line 13 changed it to header to an inline element. 

To each img I added a alt and given a descrition on the imagine. 


In style.css changing the the muliple class= benefits lead, benefits-cost, and benefits-brand img and combine them into one.
